                                                  Weather Analysis
Scope and Description:
We will be creating a database on weather analysis from 2017-2022. Historic weather statistics in the range of minimum, maximum and average temperatures in The United States will be analysed and manipulated. Moreover, the other parameters which would be included in the dataset are:
1.Dew point in F
2.Humidity in percentage
3.Wind speed in mph
4.Pressure in inches
5.Precipitation in inches
6.Temperature in F
This database analysis will create awareness of extreme weather conditions and prevent life-threatening situations.
Impact of the project:
During the past times due to un-informed weather analysis problematic situations like heavy traffic, flooding and snow storms have occurred. Thus, with the help of our processed dataset we intend to solve these problems by creating awareness of severe weather conditions.
Use Cases:
This project will help us to make the following data interpretations –
•	Agriculture affected due to heavy rainfall and extreme humidity.
•	Heavy traffic due to flooding and snowfall.
•	Floods due to heavy rainfalls.
•	Wind energy utilization in consistent windy regions
•	Favourable tourist conditions / vacation itinerary 
•	Scheduling sports tournaments/matches according to suitable weather conditions
•	Planning appropriate apparels.
•	Rate of illness in a particular region.
